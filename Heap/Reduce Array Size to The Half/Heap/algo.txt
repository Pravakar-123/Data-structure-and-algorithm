APPROACH 2: HEAP (PriorityQueue)
====================================================
Algorithm:
1. Count frequencies of all numbers.
2. Insert all frequencies into a max-heap.
3. Keep polling largest frequency and add to removed count.
4. Stop when removed >= n/2, count number of pops as answer.

TC: O(n log m)   [heapify + polling]
SC: O(m)         [frequency map + heap]
