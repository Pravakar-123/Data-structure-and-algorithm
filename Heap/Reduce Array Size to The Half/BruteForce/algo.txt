APPROACH 1: BRUTE FORCE (Exponential)
====================================================
Algorithm:
1. Count frequencies of all numbers.
2. Let m = number of unique numbers.
3. For every subset of these m numbers (2^m possibilities):
   - Compute how many elements would be removed if we delete that subset.
   - If removed >= n/2, update answer with min size of subset.
4. Return minimum set size.

TC: O(m * 2^m)   [exponential]
SC: O(m)         [for frequency map]
